## 📌 Overview

**Firewall** is an AI-driven security solution designed to create a safer environment for users in the Web3 ecosystem. Unlike traditional firewalls, it combines machine learning, real-time traffic analysis, and blockchain integration to detect, prevent, and respond to threats with greater accuracy and efficiency.

As decentralized technologies grow rapidly, security risks such as phishing attacks, scam transactions, and malicious wallet activity are becoming increasingly common. This project addresses these challenges by acting as a monitoring and alerting system for crypto wallets, providing a multi-layer defense system that protects networks, decentralized applications (DApps), and digital assets against cyber attacks and unauthorized access.

Kwala Firewall leverages Kwala APIs and tools to track wallet interactions continuously, analyzing transaction behavior and flagging anything that appears abnormal or potentially harmful. The solution is designed to be lightweight, efficient, and easy to integrate into existing Web3 applications and wallets, making it accessible to both developers and everyday users.

## 🎯 Motivation

The rise of decentralized finance (DeFi) and Web3 platforms has created exciting opportunities but also significant risks. New users often fall victim to scams, fake links, and malicious contracts, losing valuable assets. Kwala Firewall was designed during a hackathon as a proactive solution to reduce these risks.

Our vision was to build a tool that not only addresses the security gaps in blockchain interactions but also promotes trust and confidence in Web3 technologies. The goal is to provide users with timely alerts that help them avoid scams or fraudulent activities before they cause damage.

## 🚀 Key Features

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

### Languages
- **Python** – Backend processing and ML models
- **Rust** – High-performance security components
- **JavaScript/TypeScript** – Frontend and Web3 integration
- **Solidity** – Smart contract development

### Frameworks & Tools
- **Backend**: Flask/Django for API development
- **Frontend**: React.js for monitoring dashboard
- **AI/ML**: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow for threat detection
- **Security Tools**: Wireshark, Kismet, Zenmap
- **Database**: MongoDB / SQLite
- **Web3**: Web3.js, Ethers.js, Kwala APIs
- **Blockchain**: Solidity for smart contracts

## 🔧 Solidity Packed-Encoding Utilities

This sub-module is part of the [ethers project](https://github.com/ethers-io/ethers.js). It contains functions to perform Solidity-specific packed (i.e. non-standard) encoding operations, which are crucial for smart contract security analysis and transaction verification.

For more information, see the [documentation](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/api/utils/hashing/#utils--solidity-hashing).

### Importing

Most users will prefer to use the [umbrella package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ethers), but for those with more specific needs, individual components can be imported:

```javascript
const {
    pack,
    keccak256,
    sha256
} = require("@ethersproject/solidity");
```

These utilities enable the firewall to:
- Verify transaction encoding integrity
- Detect malformed or suspicious data patterns
- Analyze smart contract function calls
- Hash and validate blockchain data securely
